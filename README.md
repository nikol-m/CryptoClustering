# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The concept of Cryptocurrency Clustering entails a venture with the objective of categorizing distinct cryptocurrencies based on their market data, thereby unearthing underlying patterns and correlations.

Project Overview
This undertaking harnesses a spectrum of data science methodologies and tools, encompassing KMeans clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and interactive visualization via hvplot. Through the application of clustering to cryptocurrencies, we can attain a heightened comprehension of market dynamics, facilitating more astute investment decisions.

Data Compilation
The dataset employed in this endeavor encompasses a gamut of market metrics for diverse cryptocurrencies, encompassing the percentage adjustments in prices across varying timeframes.

Attributes
- Data Cleansing & Exploration: The task involved the loading and exploration of cryptocurrency market data, accompanied by an initial visualization of data trends.
- Data Preprocessing: To enhance clustering outcomes, the data underwent normalization through scikit-learn's StandardScaler.
- KMeans Clustering: The incorporation of KMeans clustering served to cluster the array of cryptocurrencies.
- Elbow Method: The elbow method was employed to discern the optimal cluster count (k) for the dataset.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Through PCA, data dimensionality was reduced for visualization purposes, while also gauging the impact of dimensionality reduction on 
  clustering outcomes.
- Visual Presentation: Interactive visualizations utilizing hvplot were leveraged to facilitate visual scrutiny of clusters and the elbow curve.

Key Discoveries
Optimal Cluster Count: Both the original dataset and the PCA-reduced data indicate an optimal value of 4 for the parameter k.
PCA Explained Variance: The three principal components utilized in PCA accounted for approximately 89.5% of the cumulative variance.
Cluster Analysis: Based on scatter plots, two clusters stood apart from the remainder, hinting at distinctive attributes of these cryptocurrencies in contrast to the majority.
